        <p>For most trips, airfare is the most expensive part of the trip. While prices for transatlantic flights have gone down in recent years, they can still put a sizeable dent in any travel budget. Whether you’re a budget solo traveler or a family looking to vacation abroad, finding a cheap flight deal can be what makes or breaks your trip.</p>
        <p>After all, if your flight is too expensive, you’re likely going to keep putting the trip off. I’ve seen it happen time and time again.</p>
        <p>And yet every day, airlines have thousands of amazing deals — from mistakenly published fares to special promotions to slashing prices to compete with another airline. Cheap fares are out and they can make your dream trip a reality — if you know where to look.</p>
        <p>Today, I am going to help you master the art of finding a cheap flight. These are the exact steps I’ve been following for a decade to get the cheapest airfare possible every time I fly. If you follow them too, you’ll never be the person on a flight who paid the most for their ticket!</p>
        <p>Here’s how to find a cheap flight no matter where you want to go in the world:</p>

            <h2>1. Ignore the Myths</h2>
            <p>The first thing to know about finding a cheap flight is that there is no magic bullet or one secret ninja trick to doing so. There are a lot of myths online about how to find cheap flights. In fact, you’ve probably come across a ton of them on your search to find the best flight deal!</p>
            <p>They are all lies. They will lead you astray.</p>
            <p>Most websites hire terrible reporters who recycle common and outdated myths. Here are the most common that are 100% not true:</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>It is NOT cheaper to buy airfare on a Tuesday (or any other specific day for that matter)</li>
                <li>There is NO evidence that searching incognito leads to cheaper deals (though it won’t hurt to try)</li>
                <li>There is NO exact date or specific time period in which to book your airfare</li>
                <li>You can’t predict airline prices and websites that do are basically taking an educated (but probably wrong) guess</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Airlines used advanced computer and pricing algorithms to determine prices and run sales based on the time of the year, passenger demand, weather, major events/festivals, time of day, competitor prices, fuel prices, and much more. Those so-called “tricks” don’t work anymore. The system is too smart. Throw them out. Let them die.</p>
            <p>And don’t listen to anyone who tells you otherwise. Anyone who is telling you doesn’t know what they are talking about!</p>

        <div id="2">
            <h2>2. Be Flexible with Your Travel Dates and Times</h2>
            <p>Airline ticket prices vary greatly depending on the day of the week, time of year, and upcoming holidays, such as Christmas, New Year’s Eve, Thanksgiving, or the Fourth of July. August is a big month for traveling around Europe, and everyone wants to go somewhere warm in the winter or travel when the kids are out of school.</p>
            <p>In a nutshell, if you are going to fly when everyone is flying, then you’re ticket is going to cost more.</p>
            <p>Try to be flexible with your dates. If you are dead-set on visiting Paris, go to Paris in the spring or fall when fewer people visit and airfares are cheaper.</p>
            <p>But if you want to go in the middle of August? You’re out of luck. Hawaii over Christmas? Good luck! Prices will be at their highest.</p>
            <p>The solution is to fly off-season. Search alternative dates so that you can capitalize on the best day. The more rigid your plans, the less likely it will be that you find a deal.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it’s almost always cheaper to fly during the middle of the week than on a weekend because most people travel on the weekends and airlines hike their prices then. Prices are also cheaper if you fly after a major holiday as are early-morning or late-night flights are cheaper because fewer people want to travel then (who wants to wake up early?!).</p>
            <p>In short, the difference of one day can mean hundreds of dollars in savings.</p>
            <p>Airlines are not dumb. They know when a festival, holiday, major sports event, or school break is coming up — and they raise prices accordingly.</p>
            <p>Be flexible with your dates and you’ll likely be able to save yourself some money.</p>

        <div id="3">
            <h2>3. Be Flexible with Your Destinations</h2>
            <p>If you can’t be flexible about <b><i>when</i></b> you fly, at least be flexible with <b><i>where</i></b> you fly. It’s best to be both, but if you really want to save the most money and get a cheap flight for your trip, you at least need to be flexible with one or the other.</p>
            <p>Airline search engines have made it really easy to search the entire world to find the cheapest ticket. You no longer have to search manually, city by city, day by day. Websites like Skyscanner, Momondo, and Google Flights all offer explore tools that allow you to put in your home airport and see a map of the world with all the flights on it. This allows you to easily compare multiple destinations without having to brainstorm every possible option. You’ll likely even find some interesting destinations you hadn’t even thought of either!</p>

            <p><b>Step 2:</b>Next, but in your departure city and the date. Now you can look at a wide variety of options on the map.</p>

            <p>The truth about airfare is that there’s always a deal to some destination — it might just not be your first choice. However, if you’re flexible about where you want to go, you’ll always get a deal and save a ton of money in the process.</p>
            <p>When you are locked into one place at one time, you are stuck with whatever price shows up. Nothing can change that. But when you become flexible, suddenly the entire world opens up to you and you’ll find amazing cheap airfares!</p>

           <h2>4. Fly Budget Carriers</h2>
           <p>Years ago, if you wanted to fly between continents, you were mostly stuck with traditional expensive airlines. That’s no longer true. Budget airlines now service many long-haul routes, making it possible to fly around the world for very little money.</p>
           <p>Norwegian Airlines allows you to fly between Europe and Bangkok for as little as $250 each way.</p>
           <p>AirAsia offers crazy-cheap deals around Asia and Australia for under $100 USD each way.</p>
           <p>Indian and Middle Eastern airlines offer cheap flights throughout the subcontinent and Africa.</p>
           <p>These days, you can fly most of the way around the world on a budget airline. Sure, they might not be as comfortable and you may need to pay for premium upgrades like checked bags and meals, but they bring the world to your doorstep without breaking the bank.</p> 
            <p>Flying the budget airlines is a good alternative to flying “the majors” whenever possible. You get fewer perks, but you can save a bundle in price.</p>
            <p>Just be sure to watch out for fees. That’s how they make money! Budget airlines often charge fees for checked bags, carry-ons, printing your boarding pass, using a credit card, and anything else they can get away with. Be sure to add up the cost of the ticket AND the fees to make sure that the price is lower than a larger carrier.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="5">
            <h2>5. Don’t Always Fly Direct</h2>
            <p>Not only does it help to be flexible with dates and destinations but being flexible with the route you take is another way to get a cheap flight. For example, sometimes it’s cheaper to fly to London and take a budget airline to Amsterdam than to fly direct to Amsterdam from your departure city.</p>
            <p>I did precisely this when I was going to Paris. The flight from the US was $900 USD, but I could fly to Dublin for $600 and get a $60 flight to Paris. It meant more flying time, but the $240 USD I saved was worth it to me.</p>
            <p>To use this method, find out how much it is to go directly to your destination. Then, open Google Flights and type in that destination’s continent to look at prices to nearby airports. If the difference is more than $150 USD, I look to see how much it is to get from the second airport to my primary destination (either by budget flight or train, if it’s not too far)</p>
            <p>If you do book separate segments, be sure to have at least three hours between connections. This will give you space in case there is a delay as your second flight won’t wait for you (you booked with a separate airline, so they won’t care if you’re late or not).</p>
            <p>Leaving a three-hour buffer will also cover you for an insurance claim since most insurance companies require you to have at least a 3-hour delay before you can make a claim.</p>
            <p>This method is more work since you have to figure out lots of different routes and check different airlines. But it can lower the price of your flight, which is worth the extra effort if you end up saving a few hundred bucks.</p>
