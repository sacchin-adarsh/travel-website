        <p>If you’ve ever wanted to learn how to travel cheaper, experience the local side of a destination, and turn your dream trip into a reality, you are in the right place. This website will give you road tested tips, advice, and suggestions so you can see more for less.</p>
        <img id="about" src="img/About.jpg" >

        
            <p>Everyday I wake up with one goal in mind: <b>“How can I help other people travel better for less?”</b> The mission here is to produce the most comprehensive than any other website out there.</p>
        
            <p>Unlike many other travel websites, you won’t find sponsored content or paid trips here. Every place, hostel, restaurant, or attraction has been personally visited by me (or one of my guest columnists) and <b>we pay our own way</b>. We sleep in dorms and budget hotels, wait hours for buses, try those roadside street stalls, and test travel passes to see if they really do save money. We do it just like you would – because, like you, we’re real travelers looking to see the world.</p>
        
        <p>Every company recommended is here because they are useful and used in our day-to-day travels – not ones that have paid us for advertising.</p>
        
            <p><b>This website is about showing you what it’s really like on the road – not some glossy ad for a travel brand.</b></p>
        
        <p>So come, read, learn, and send a postcard from the road!</p>
